# GAMe KUP: Global Ancestry Mapping in Known and Unknown Populations
(Final Project for CS 124: Computational Genetics)
Contains R code and data files

@File
Calculate_F1_Score_easy.R to compare answer file to output file with individuals assigned to popualtions
Calculate_F1_Score_hard.R to convert answer file to individuals assignments that match the output file

PopulationAssignment_LevelEasy.R uses sampled individuals for correlation
PopulationAssignment_LevelEasy(Improved).R uses haplotype matrix for correlation

PopulationAssignment_LevelHard.R uses kmeans only
PopulationAssignment_LevelHard(Improved).R uses PCA and kmeans together


Week 6: Search HapMap and 1000 Genomes Project for examples of populations that have been studied 
Grade: 5% Progress


Week 7: Practice working with genotype data and downloading data into R
Grade: 10% Progress

Week 8: Try simple haplotype phasing 
Grade: 15% Progress

Week 9 and 10: Use correlation matrix to make predictions on easy data
